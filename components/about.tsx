      After completing a year of study in Creative Writing at Singapore Polytechnic, I came to the realization that my true passion lay elsewhere.
      Thus, I made the decision to shift my focus and pursue a course in <span className="font-bold">programming</span>, which ultimately led me to discover a genuine enthusiasm for addressing real-world challenges and making a direct and positive impact on others.

      real-world problem-solving and positively impacting others through programming. {" "}
      I am particularly drawn to the prospect of contributing to the healthtech industry, driven by a desire to bring about meaningful change for patients and caretakers alike.
